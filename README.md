**Title:**
Assessment of human leukocyte antigen-based neoantigen presentation to determine pan-cancer response to immunotherapy

**Running title:**
HLA neoantigen presentation-based ICI response prediction

**Abstract:**
Despite the central role of human leukocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) in tumor neoantigen presentation, quantitative determination of presentation capacity remains elusive. Based on a pooled pan-cancer genomic dataset of patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), we developed a score integrating the binding affinity of neoantigens to HLA-I, as well as HLA-I allele divergence, termed the HLA tumor-Antigen Presentation Score (HAPS). Patients with a high HAPS were more likely experience survival benefit following ICI treatment. Our findings highlight the clinical utility of evaluating HLA-I tumor antigen presentation capacity and describe how ICI response may depend on HLA-mediated immunity.
